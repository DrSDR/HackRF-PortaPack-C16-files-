copy these files to your sd card of the hackrf portapack
the captures folder is a good place.

once these files are on the sd card and the sd card is installed back into the hackrf portapack

go to replay button and select Spectrum_IQ.C16

tune rtl-sdr radio to 915mhz and you should see:
hello radio
in the waterfall


then tune a sdr waterfall to 915MHz to see spectrum art
set span to 500khz 

hello radio!!


to make a new c16 file, a matlab or gnu octave script is attached as well.

gnu octave is free and works for linux and windows.
